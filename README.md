# Flight Perturbation Problem

Real-time Optimization problem using Metaheuristics (Simulated Annealing, Fire Fly and Ant Colony Optimization algorithms)

The problem with flight scheduling is whenever the schedule is disrupted, it will not only cause inconvenience to passenger, but also bring about a large amount of operational losses to airlines. 
Especially in case an irregular flight happens, the event is unanticipated frequently. 
In order to obtain an optimal policy in airline operations, it is important to minimize the negative consequences of this disturbance.
Here, a tabu search approach to the flight perturbation problem is presented.
The heuristics use a tree-search algorithm to find new schedules for the aircraft, the computational results indicate that tabu search can be successfully used to solve the flight perturbation problem.
